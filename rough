## Notes
##### June 3

- vagrant (similar to docker & linux) automate building vm on personal laptop (laptop version of cloud)
- will have theoretical skillset to build cloud automation
- current config testing: create then kill test stack
  - use Jenkins server (costly for quick checks)
- want: tool that click button/simple command (i.e. `vagrant up`) -> local cluster of vms w/ indexers, clustermaster, search head & imported data in Splunk instance
- use sample data from online (NYC taxi routes)
- spin up lightest version (likely ubuntu) -> build vm & install splunk -> pull in data (`wget` or command line)
- *action items*: research into vm, vagrant, VirtualBox

## High-level Overview
1. single splunk instance w/ data
2. clustered instances w/ data

## Steps
1. Set up vagrant to create a VM that hosts a basic webpage that says "hello world" or whatever lame ass thing
2. Use the same approach to set up a VM that hosts an instance of splunk
3. Set this up so that you can navigate to that using a hostname
4. Once you get real confident build a whole cluster :lol:
